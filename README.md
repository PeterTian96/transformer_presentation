## Introduction and Overview
The paper addresses the problem of machine translation, which involves translating a sentence from one language to another. Rather than using RNN model, The authors propose a new approach that uses a large deep LSTM neural network to directly translate sentences.

**RNN VS. LSTM** 
**RNN**
Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a type of neural network that are designed to process sequential data. 
Advantage:

Disadvantage:

**LSTM**
The authors chose to use LSTMs instead of traditional RNNs because LSTMs are better at handling long-term dependencies, which are crucial in machine translation.



**Approach:**
